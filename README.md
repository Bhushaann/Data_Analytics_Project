# Data_Analytics_Project
## Gist
My Capstone Project for Google Data Analytics where I had a few Problem Statements about a company, Was provided with a raw public dataset. The data was available in a monthly format, I downloaded the data in Excel format ( 10 Excel files ) Later stacked them up with power query which resulted in aporox 5.8 Million rows of data, Cleaned the data after which it resulted in around 4.4 million rows of data, Transformed/Prepared it in various ways, Later Visualised it with the help of Microsoft Power Bi making interactive Dashboards & Reports.
## About the Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. They offer three types of passes for their Customers: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclisticâ€™s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno (Stakeholder) believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. Moreno has set a clear goal.
## Problem Statements
* Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.
* How annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership
* How digital media could affect their marketing tactics.
* Team is interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends

## About the Data Set
The data was contained in .zip format as per their month after downloading. 
The data was further unzipped, Later transferred to excel. It was stacked up on Microsoft Power Query editor. It had a lot of empty cells in a lot of columns, Data was jumbled it, not in the right format.

## How I cleaned & Manipulated it
* Raw data had a cell in Date/Time Format containing both from which I made the start Date, end date & start Time, end time Separate
* From the End time & Start time I calculated the trip duration and handle the negative outputs by Square & Square root
* From Date column, I extracted the Quarter, Day name, Months name, Weekday/Weekend
* From time I extracted the Hours of the day in 24 hour format.
 Here are the applied steps to the entire Data set.
